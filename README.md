# java-codes

A collection of Java codes for university requirements. Assets such as images have not been included and would need replacement files to run the codes again.

Most of the codes are simple and serve as practice. Some more complex codes that aim to recreate various games and programs such as chess, hangman, and a Pokemon card visualizer can be found in module 6. Code for the game breakout can also be found in Module 5.
